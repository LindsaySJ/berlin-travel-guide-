## Essential things to do in Berlin

**Spend a day on the Museum Island**

At the eastern end of Unter den Linden is the Museum Island, a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site lying in the middle of the Spree. It’s home to five of Berlin’s most important museums: two not to be missed are the Neues Museum and the spectacular [Pergamonmuseum] (http://www.timeout.com/berlin/en/attractions-and-museums/pergamonmuseum), one of the world’s major archaeological museums. 

**Walk the Berlin Wall**

The Wall was mostly demolished between June and November 1990 although a restored stretch remains along the southern border of Wedding and Mitte. Visit Checkpoint Charlie, the famous east-west border control during the Cold War and now a tourist centre, for comprehensive display boards telling the Wall’s story. For more of a visual history, take a walk along the Wall by the Spree, where it runs between the Freidrichshain-Kreuzberg districts. Whereas graffiti has been removed from the northern section of the Wall, the one-mile stretch known as the East Side Gallery is dedicated to art and preserves the paintings made on the eastern side when the Wall was brought down. Although attempting to preserve the spirit of the time, an argument blew up when the restoration project of recent years was seen to overstep the mark, with original artworks being painted over without the artists’ permission.

**Hunt down bargains in Mauer Park (The Berliner Delores Park)**

Berliners embrace their green spaces and the long strip of grass along the middle of Prenzlauer Berg’s Mauerpark (open daily from 8am–sunset) is best known not as a relaxing spot but a mecca for energetic market-lovers. The park hosts a massive flea market on Sundays, with vendors selling bargain bicycles, clothes, food, souvenirs, records, pianos and furniture. **Pro Tip**: Check out the sunday afternoon Karaoke at Mauerpark in Berlin.


**Dance until sunrise** :dancer: 

Berliners know how to party. **Protip** Head to Berghain/Panorama Bar, on the border between Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain: this former factory is the bedrock of European techno. Alternatively, the ramshackle place that is Salon Zur Wilden Renate nods at more of an underground house party vibe, with three main dance rooms but other corners tucked away off the sides and mezzanine levels for nosying about. It’s truly an adventure playground, with a labyrinth underground (see Hidden Berlin). Watergate is also suffuse with house heritage – the downstairs Water Floor is particularly impressive with its panorama windows looking directly out onto the Spree, as well as a floating deck terrace for watching the sunrise over Kreuzberg.

**Explore Berlin's Jewish history**

The Jüdisches Museum presents the story of Berlin’s Jewish population through the Museum’s own architecture. The newest and most eye-catching section of the building was designed by controversial Jewish architect Daniel Libeskind. Its shape is based on an exploding Star of David, with its interior spaces disappearing into angles, so the museum experience is more about the effects of the space than the documents and artifacts. Across Oranienburger Straße is the Neue Synagogue: built in the late 19th century this building survived World War II, and its golden dome stands out from afar. For more of an emotional way into history, walk night or day through the Denkmal für die Ermordeten Juden Europas – also known as the Holocaust Memorial. This memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe takes the form of 2,711 blocks of varying heights arranged across the area of a housing block.

**Check out Berlin’s art scene** :art:

The Kulturforum is a low-rise museum complex south of Tiergarten housing world-class galleries. The biggest draw is the Gemäldegalerie, whose collection of early European painting contains English, Spanish and Italian Renaissance works, among which the highlights are paintings by Dutch and Flemish masters Frans Hals and Rembrandt. A short stroll along from the Old Masters is the bold glass cube of the Neue Nationalgalerie. Designed in the 1960s by Mies van der Rohe, it houses 20th-century paintings. It’s particularly strong on Expressionism, with key pieces by Kirchner, Heckel and Schmidt-Rottluff besides a cluster of Cubist works by Picasso, Gris and Léger.

**Relax by the Spree**

Berliners certainly make the most of summer. Bars such as Yaam and Chez Jacki line the banks of the Spree to the north while Club der Visionäre sits on stilts on an inlet to the river on the border of the districts of Kreuzberg and Treptow. The Badeschiff gets very busy on the warmest summer days, but after a day in the heat, take a plunge in this barge-cum-chlorinated swimming pool to cool off. Get a drink from the bar and colonise a warm patch on decking or sand as DJs enter to play out the evenings. Fortunately, in the winter the area is transformed into an indoor complex with a sauna in riposte to the bitter weather.

**Discover an older Berlin at Charlottenburg gardens**

At the west end of the city, the charming palace and garden complex of Schloss Charlottenburg has the look of a mini-Versailles. Built as a summer retreat for Queen Sophie-Charlotte by her husband Friedrich I, the first king of Prussian, it was named after Charlotte following her early death in 1705. Following damage in the World War II, the residence has been restored to glory as the last surviving palace belonging to the powerful Hohenzollern family and the only royal residency in the city. Inside the highlight has to be the Neue Flügel (New Wing), where by Friedrich I’s successor, Frederick the Great made his mark. This suite of opulent Rococo state apartments includes the Golden Gallery, dripping in gilt, in contrast to the restrained classical winter chambers of the third inhabitant, Friedrich Wilhelm. The gardens outside however are also a gem: at the end stands a Pavilion designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the architect behind the neoclassical Altes Museum on Museum Island. Outside, the lush gardens, modelled on the decadent style of Louis XIV of France, the Sun King, are the perfect place for a romantic stroll.

**Ascend to an iconic vantage point**

Berlin’s architecture has a fascinating range, from the historical to high modernism and more controversial postmodern projects. A visit to the Reichstag, the home of the German Parliament, provides the perfect overview. Opened in 1894, its renovation was masterminded by British super-architect Norman Foster and completed in 1999. The roof is an entirely glass structure, allowing for a panoramic view of the city right from the centre of government. Entrance to the roof is free but you must register in advance; once you’re in make this a totally informative experience by plugging into the audio tour and heading to the open roof for an overview of the sites all around. Alternative views can be found by taking Europe’s fastest elevator to the Panoramapunkt on the 24th and 25th floors of the Kollhoff Tower in Potsdamer Platz. Over in the east of the city is Fernsehturm, rising over 200 metres above Alexanderplatz. The iconic tower is Europe’s fourth tallest free-standing structure and the stainless steel sphere contains a revolving restaurant and viewing gallery. On clear days visibility can reach 40 kilometres.

**Fun facts**

* Berlinerisch is a dialect of Berlin Brandenburgish German spoken in Berlin and the surrounding metropolitan area. It originates from a Mark Brandenburgish variant. Phrases in Berlinisch are unique to the city, indicating the manifold origins of immigrants, among them the Huguenots from France.
