## Essential things to do in Berlin

**Spend a day on the Museum Island**

At the eastern end of Unter den Linden is the Museum Island, a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site lying in the middle of the Spree. It’s home to five of Berlin’s most important museums: two not to be missed are the Neues Museum and the spectacular [Pergamonmuseum] (http://www.timeout.com/berlin/en/attractions-and-museums/pergamonmuseum), one of the world’s major archaeological museums. 

**Walk the Berlin Wall**

The Wall was mostly demolished between June and November 1990 although a restored stretch remains along the southern border of Wedding and Mitte. Visit Checkpoint Charlie, the famous east-west border control during the Cold War and now a tourist centre, for comprehensive display boards telling the Wall’s story. For more of a visual history, take a walk along the Wall by the Spree, where it runs between the Freidrichshain-Kreuzberg districts. Whereas graffiti has been removed from the northern section of the Wall, the one-mile stretch known as the East Side Gallery is dedicated to art and preserves the paintings made on the eastern side when the Wall was brought down. Although attempting to preserve the spirit of the time, an argument blew up when the restoration project of recent years was seen to overstep the mark, with original artworks being painted over without the artists’ permission.

**Hunt down bargains in Mauer Park (The Berliner Delores Park)**

The Mauerk Park is a mecca for energetic park and market-lovers. The park hosts a massive flea market on Sundays, with vendors selling bargain bicycles, clothes, food, records, pianos and furniture. **Pro Tip**: Check out the sunday afternoon Karaoke at Mauerpark in Berlin.

**Dance until sunrise** :dancer: 

Berliners know how to party. **Pro Tip** Head to Berghain/Panorama Bar, on the border between Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain: this former factory is the bedrock of European techno. Also check out Salon Zur Wilden Renate where you can enjoy a :cool: house party vibe, with three main dance rooms. It’s truly an adventure playground, with a labyrinth underground (see Hidden Berlin). Watergate is also a great club to dance the night away. The downstairs floor in the Watergate has a great panorama window looking directly out onto the Spree, as well as a floating deck terrace for watching the sunrise over Kreuzberg.

**Check out Berlin’s art scene** 

The Kulturforum is a museum complex south of Tiergarten housing world-class art galleries. The biggest draw is the Gemäldegalerie, whose collection of early European painting contains English, Spanish and Italian Renaissance works. 

**Relax by the Spree**

Berliners certainly make the most of summer. Bars such as Yaam and Chez Jacki line the banks of the Spree to the north while Club der Visionäre sits on stilts on an inlet to the river on the border of the districts of Kreuzberg and Treptow. 

**Visit the Rechstag and enjoy the view from the roof**

A visit to the Reichstag, the home of the German Parliament, provides the perfect overview. The roof of the Reichstag is an entirely glass structure, allowing for a panoramic view of the city right from the centre of government. Entrance to the roof is free but you should try to register in advance. 

**Discover an older Berlin at Charlottenburg gardens**

Check out the impressive Schloss Charlottenburg at the west end of the city which has the look of a mini-Versailles. 

**Speak like a Berliner...**

Berlinerisch is a metrolect – a mixture of different dialects spoken in Berlin. It originates from a Mark Brandenburgish variant. Phrases in Berlinisch are unique to the city. 

Want to sounds like a local in Berlin? Here's how:

* “ich” (I) becomes “ick”
This may please all native speakers of English. In Berlin dialect the soft ch-sound in the word “ich” (I) becomes a k-sound.
Ick hab keene Zeit. / Ich habe keine Zeit. (I don’t have time.)

* The expression “wa”
The word “wa” has different meanings. It can either be a question tag at the end of a sentence or a form of “wir” (we).
“Da ham wa aba noch mal Glück jehabt, wa?” / “Da haben wir aber noch mal Glück gehabt, oder/nicht wahr?” (Lucky us, aren’t we?)
